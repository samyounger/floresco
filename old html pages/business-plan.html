                <h2>Investment Thesis</h2>
									<ol>
										<li>The cheapest financial services platform available. 10bps per annum fee on everything.</li>
										<li>Execution only, advisory, MPS or discretionary all the same cost.</li>
										<li>Target market - 0-100k pf giving discretionary service implemented by the client. A new blend of xo and discretionary.</li>
										<li>Seamless integration between banking and portfolio i.e. Sell today instant cash availability. </li>
										<li>1/3rd of firm profits saved in fund to be stored, clients can vote in the event of a recession to buy shares they favour I.e. Prop up unfavourable market stocks in an effort to reduce market volatility.</li>
										<li>Seed funding platform that demands higher standards from cos (accounts, forecast of growth etc) and gives advice from professional analyst. </li>
										<li>Offers platform for companies to raise capital directly from the consumer cutting out middle man. Again advice given on value etc.</li>
										<li>Fund advice automatically diverts to others once the fund reaches a certain size. Full look through availability. ESG capability using the look-through. If there is a material change in recommendation automatic email to client advising what to do. </li>
										<li>Full suitability questionnaire.</li>
										<li>Portfolio analysis tools helping clients understand performance and risk. Look-through technology with all fund providers that are on the platform (a condition of their acceptance onto the platform)</li>
										<li>Enable the client to shop via the website.</li>
										<li>Enable the client to bank via the website. Full financial budget forecasting, and tie in with shopping. I.e. If they add something to the basket it forecasts how long it will take to pay off with salary. Also could suggest automatically financing solutions if high cost.</li>
										<li>Mortgage comparison solutions. Automatic financial advice on the size of mortgage they could take out, the total cost EAR.</li>
										<li>Insurance? Not sure about this.</li>
										<li>Essentially the idea is that for anything that involves money, the website is there to do everything.</li>
										<li>Financial education software, either targetted at schools, or through the website</li>
