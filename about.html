        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Floresco's philosophy is simple; open up finance to the world. The investment community his historically been primarily focused around the professionals. In particular the access to in-depth thinking, knowledge and data. Private investors first call for market knowledge is usually a professional broker, or discretionary investment manager.</p>
        <p>We have constructed an investment platform where all investors; professional and non-professional have to access market data for free, share knowledge, analysis,  portfolio construction and performance.</p>
        <h2>Why are we better than the competition?</h2>
        <p>I cannot answer that explicitly for you. I can however demonstrate a few of our attributes that we believe give users of our platform a significant edge over the competition.</p>
        <p>Cost: we charge our users a flat 10 basis points per annum (0.10%) on all assets you hold on the platform. You do not however have to have any assets on the platform to gain access to all of our information. You will just miss out on exciting cutting-edge developments such as replicate other successful investors, use the portfolio construction tools, or share your successful trades with the wider world</p>
        <p>Share you knowledge: this is not just an investment platform, it is also an investment community. We do not do any investment management, that is purely our users sharing their wealth of knowledge. If you have a good idea, share it with the world. If you analyse a stock and believe it is a buy or a sell, tell the world. If you are successful and investors like what you do and write about, they can rate you. If you get a good rating and you have enough followers, you can charge for other users to access your knowledge. How much you charge is entirely up to you, we will charge 10% of your fee.</p>
        <p>Follow other investors: you can follow any investor on the platform that has given permission for others to see their portfolio (obviously excluding any personal details & actual monetary values). If you want to follow a friend and compare your portfolios risk levels, portfolio constrution, or performance, you can do that. If you want to replicate someone else's portfolio exactly you can allocate a certain percentage of your portfolio to track theirs, thereby when they trade, you trade.</p>
        <p>If you reach enough followers of your portfolio you can charge users a percentage on the assets they have following you, just like a Fund manager. We felt this was important for the investment manager to be compensated for loss of market liquidity. The investor that is being followed will be able to see how much assets are following him and therefore be able to manage liquidity on an ongoing basis.</p>
        <p>Professional investment managers: It is important to recognise that the professional investment community have additional knowledge from a career in the industry. As such you can see whether the investor you are following is a professional investor or not, along with other users rating of them. This should give you a better idea to evaluate the professionalism of that investor before you 'buy in'.</p>
        <p>Transparency: We believe transparency is very important, to know how much you are being charged per annum for the management of your portfolio. We will show you exactly how much you have been charged. Please see below an example:</p>
