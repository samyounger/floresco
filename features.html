    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>The Floresco platform aims to provide you with as much information as you could possible need to manage a portfolio in a professional way for the absolute minimal cost.</p>
    <h2>Floresco Community</h2>
    <p>The Floresco community is what makes this platform. When came up with the idea for this platform we wanted to solve a fundamental problem with asset management - the high cost. As we all know the people managing assets are the highest cost in any portfolio being managed. Therefore how do you construct a business which does investment management without managing any investments. The answer is that we give you all the tools to manage your own portfolios on the platform for minimal cost, and you can all share with each other your portfolio management skills and investment analysis.<br>
    This section gives provides ground-breaking technology that summarises everything about you. It gives all users access to your profile where they can see all the important issues relating to your portfolio including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Holdings</li>
        <li>Asset allocation</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <li>A schedule of your transactions with performance of the trade in a line-chart where you bought and sold, and any comments you have attributed to the trade</li>
        <li>Latest comments by you</li>
        <li>Latest research by you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here other users can view all of the above, and provide a rating from 1-5 stars on your skills at:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Investment management</li>
        <li>Research analysis</li>
        <li>Market comments</li>
        <li>Trading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If users have looked at your investment profile and like what they see, they can potentially subscribe to follow your market news and analysis, or follow your portfolio where you receive a management fee you charge them for your expertise.</p>
    <h2>Portfolio Analytics</h2>
    <p>The portfolio analytics section should provide you with all information required to analyse your portfolio. As a portfolio manager there are certain features that are absolutely essential in managing the risks your wealth is exposed to. To name a few these include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Asset allocation</li>
        <li>Geographic equity allocation</li>
        <li>Currency allocation</li>
        <li>Industrial sector allocation</li>
        <li>Volatility</li>
        <li>Performance versus peers, short-term benchmark and long-term benchmark</li>
        <li>Volatility vs. performance - i.e. for each unit of risk you are taking, are you achieving a positive return for that risk</li>
        <li>Market views of your investments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the free investment analytic tools available from alternate sources, this information usually has to be compiled manually. In other words you need to know what is required to manage a portfolio efficiently, before you even start. Education is an important facet of portfolio management, even the best managers are continuously learning. We provide you with as much guidance is possible in making the right decision in managing the risk to achieve your long-term investment goals.</p>
    <h2>Market Data</h2>
    <p>Financial markets primarily revolve around data. Historic data, present data, expected future data. Investors the world over spend their time analysing investments, markets, economics to find the 'right' price that an asset is worth. If a companies future growth is going to be lower than expected, then that lower future growth must be discounted back to the present at a suitable rate, thereby lowering the present value. This is why there are such big movemenets in the price of high growth companies when their growth beats, or misses market expectations. As this market data is so essential, we clearly cannot provide you with future data, but we can provide you with the required data to analyse markets & investments to come up with your own expected growth forecasts, and share these with the world.
    Floresco provides data for the main investable asset classes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed Interest</li>
        <li>Equities</li>
        <li>Property</li>
        <li>Alternatives</li>
        <li>Liquid Assets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This section not only provides you with data for the above asset classes, but links in forecast data from other users of our platform, thereby giving you some indication of future forecasts - whether you agree with them or not. Disagree with forecasts, make your own and publish them so others can see.</p>
    <h2>Economics</h2>
    <p>Is economics an art or a science? Markets place great stock in changes to economic forecasts and historic data, and so you should keep your finger on the pulse of the worlds shifting economics. Here you can make your own economic forecasts, provide the capability of commenting on data, and link your comments, forecasts or historic data to your other analysis and how you think it might influence your analysis of that investment.</p>
    <h2>Trading</h2>
    <p>A simple but clear platform is of utmost importance to ensure you can place your trades fast, and correctly. Rather than making you calculate investment percentages and nominal units to purchase, you can enter a percentage and select whether this is for; the portfolio, equities, fixed interst, property, alternatives or liquid assets.</p>
    <p>When placing the deal, before striking the trade we will give full detail of its costs, market commissions you are paying and any tax due (such as stamp duty).</p>
